# Insertion Time Complexity Experiment

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate both insertion and search's time complexity of HashMap, ArrayList, and LinkedList data structures. The purpose of this project is to further understand the importance of choosing the right data structure and practice of constructing, inserting, and searching within each data structures. 

## Implementation
Each of the data structure was given 100,000 random integers ranging from 0(inclusive) to 1 million(exclusive) to calculate the duration each data structure took to complete their insertions. On the other hand, each data structures will be searched for 100,000 random integers ranging from 0(inclusive) to 2 millions(exclusive) and calculate the duration each data structures took.
